This GitHub repository contains all the essential resources for our study on optimizing plasma etching processes through the integration of precise 3D etching simulation and machine learning techniques. The repository includes datasets, code, algorithms, and documentation necessary to replicate and build upon our research.

Datasets:
The datasets folder contains all the data used in our experiments, including 15000 simulation samples during the Cl2/HBr/O2 plasma etching simulation.

Code:
The code directory contains the Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks used for  model training and evaluation. 

Algorithms:

The algorithms section provides the pseudocode and detailed descriptions of the key algorithms employed in our study. This includes both forward and inverse modeling approaches for predicting etching profiles and identifying optimal process parameters.
